      "content": "Choose JSON when you need:\n\n**1. Hierarchical data**\nUser profiles with nested address objects, product catalogs with variant arrays, or any data with parent-child relationships. CSV can't represent nesting without workarounds.\n\n**2. API communication**\nREST and GraphQL APIs almost universally use JSON. It's the native language of web development and works seamlessly with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and every modern language.\n\n**3. Schema flexibility**\nWhen records might have different fields — like a product catalog where some items have 'color' and others have 'size' — JSON handles this naturally. CSV requires every row to match the column structure.\n\n**4. Metadata and configuration**\nApplication configs, feature flags, and settings files work better in JSON because you can nest related options and include comments (with JSON5 or similar).\n\n**JSON example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n    \"orders\": [\n      {\"id\": 1, \"total\": 50.00},\n      {\"id\": 2, \"total\": 75.50}\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```"

      "heading": "When to Use CSV",
      "content": "Choose CSV when you need:\n\n**1. Data analysis and reporting**\nExcel, Google Sheets, Tableau, and every BI tool natively imports CSV. Non-technical stakeholders can open and analyze CSV files without any coding knowledge.\n\n**2. Large datasets**\nCSV files are 30-50% smaller than equivalent JSON because they don't repeat field names for every record. A 1GB JSON file might be 600MB as CSV.\n\n**3. Database imports/exports**\nSQL databases work natively with CSV for bulk operations. Most databases have `COPY FROM` or `LOAD DATA` commands specifically for CSV.\n\n**4. Simple tabular data**\nWhen your data is flat — like a list of transactions, contacts, or inventory items — CSV is cleaner and more portable.\n\n**CSV example:**\n```csv\nname,email,order_id,total\nJohn,john@example.com,1,50.00\nJohn,john@example.com,2,75.50\n```\n\nNotice how the nested orders from JSON become separate rows in CSV."

      "heading": "How to Convert Between Formats",
      "content": "You'll often need to switch between JSON and CSV. Here's how:\n\n**JSON to CSV:**\nUse ConvertFlow's free online converter or API. It handles nested data by flattening objects and creating appropriate column headers.\n\n**CSV to JSON:**\nSame tool works bidirectionally. CSV rows become JSON objects with keys from the header row.\n\n**Python conversion:**\n```python\n# JSON to CSV\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_json('data.json')\ndf.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)\n\n# CSV to JSON\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf.to_json('output.json', orient='records')\n```\n\n**Command line:**\n```bash\n# Using jq\ncat data.json | jq -r '.[] | [.name, .email] | @csv'\n```\n\nThe right conversion tool depends on your data complexity and volume."
