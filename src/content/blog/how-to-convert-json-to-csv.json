      "heading": "Why Convert JSON to CSV?",
      "content": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the standard format for APIs and web applications. But when you need to analyze data in Excel, Google Sheets, or import into a database, CSV is often the required format.\n\nCommon use cases include exporting API data for spreadsheet analysis, preparing data for database imports, sharing data with non-technical team members, and creating reports from JSON-based systems."

      "heading": "The Fastest Way: Use ConvertFlow",
      "content": "ConvertFlow lets you convert JSON to CSV instantly in your browser. No signup required for free use.\n\n1. Paste your JSON data in the input panel\n2. Click \"Convert Now\"\n3.

    },
    {
      "heading": "Handling Nested JSON Objects",
      "content": "One challenge with JSON to CSV conversion is handling nested objects. For example, if your JSON has nested address fields like {street, city, state}, ConvertFlow automatically flattens these into separate CSV columns like address.street, address.city, and address.state.\n\nThis ensures no data is lost during conversion while maintaining a flat structure that spreadsheets can understand."

      "heading": "Using the API for Automation",
      "content": "Need to convert JSON to CSV programmatically? ConvertFlow Pro includes a REST API.\n\nSend a POST request to /api/v1/convert with your JSON data and receive CSV in response. Perfect for automated workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and data processing scripts.\n\nPro plan includes unlimited conversions, 50MB file support, and full API access at $19/month."

    {
      "heading": "JSON to CSV: Quick Reference",
      "content": "JSON arrays of objects convert cleanly to CSV where each object becomes a row and each key becomes a column header.\n\nArrays of arrays need special handling — the first array typically becomes headers.\n\nNested objects get flattened with dot notation (parent.child).\n\nArrays within objects are joined with semicolons by default.\n\nNull values become empty CSV cells."
