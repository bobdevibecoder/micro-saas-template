      "heading": "Why You Need a JSON to CSV Converter",
      "content": "JSON and CSV are two of the most common data formats, but they serve different purposes. JSON excels at storing complex, hierarchical data with nested objects and arrays. CSV shines when you need simple, flat data that opens instantly in Excel or Google Sheets.\n\nIf you're working with APIs, databases, or data exports, you'll constantly need to convert between these formats. A good JSON to CSV converter saves hours of manual work and prevents data corruption. Whether you're a developer integrating APIs, a data analyst cleaning datasets, or a marketer importing contact lists, the right tool makes all the difference."

    {
      "heading": "What Makes a Great JSON to CSV Converter",
      "content": "Not all converters are created equal. The best tools handle nested JSON structures gracefully, preserve data types, and let you customize the output. Look for these key features:\n\n• **Nested object handling**: Flattens complex JSON without losing data\n• **Large file support**: Processes files over 10MB without crashing\n• **Data preview**: Shows you the output before downloading\n• **API access**: Lets you automate conversions in your workflow\n• **Privacy-first**: Processes data locally or deletes it immediately\n• **Custom delimiters**: Supports semicolons, pipes, and other separators\n\nSpeed matters too. The best converters process thousands of rows in seconds, not minutes."

      "heading": "2. Konklone — Best for Privacy",
      "content": "Konklone (konklone.io/json) is a client-side converter that never uploads your data to a server. It's been around for years and has earned trust from privacy-conscious developers.\n\n**Key features:**\n• 100% client-side processing\n• Simple, no-frills interface\n• Handles basic JSON structures well\n• Open source\n\nThe trade-off is limited features. Konklone doesn't handle deeply nested JSON as gracefully as ConvertFlow, and there's no API. But if privacy is your absolute top priority, it's a solid choice.\n\n**Best for**: Users handling sensitive data who need client-side only processing.\n**Price**: Free"

But for power users who need maximum flexibility, ConvertCSV delivers.\n\n**Best for**: Power users converting between many formats.\n**Price**: Free tier; paid plans from $9/month"

You can handle edge cases, clean data, and automate the entire process.\n\n**Basic example:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read JSON\ndf = pd.read_json('data.json')\n\n# Flatten nested structures\ndf = pd.json_normalize(df.to_dict('records'))\n\n# Save to CSV\ndf.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n**Pros**: Unlimited flexibility, handles any data structure, automatable\n**Cons**: Requires coding knowledge, setup time\n\n**Best for**: Data engineers and developers building automated pipelines.\n**Price**: Free (open source)"
