      "heading": "Why Convert JSON to CSV?",
      "content": "JSON is the standard data format for APIs and web applications, but CSV remains the lingua franca of spreadsheets and data analysis tools. When you need to import API data into Excel, Google Sheets, or a database, converting JSON to CSV is essential. CSV files are smaller, human-readable in spreadsheet apps, and universally supported by business tools."

      "heading": "How to Use ConvertFlow for Free",

The tool handles nested JSON objects, arrays, and complex data structures automatically. No email required, no watermarks, no limits on the free tier.

    {
      "heading": "Handling Complex JSON Structures",
      "content": "Real-world JSON data is rarely flat. ConvertFlow intelligently flattens nested objects using dot notation (user.name becomes user.name column). Arrays are handled by creating multiple rows or concatenating values depending on context. The converter preserves data types and handles edge cases like null values, empty strings, and special characters in CSV output."
